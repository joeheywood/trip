Exploratory project in analysing reviews text

This is a small and simple R/Shiny application that mines text from restaurant reviews.

## Some brief aims of project:

* Better understand what is going on with restaurant reviews - and what makes people give higher/lower ratings. 
* Categorize sentences/ideas within reviews - possibly according to things like quality of food, price, service, aesthetic qualities
    - probably use k-means clustering for this?
* See if I can predict the main rating for x reviewer
