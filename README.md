Exploratory project in analysing reviews text

This is a small and simple R/Shiny application that mines text from restaurant reviews.

## Some brief aims of project:

* Better understand what is going on with restaurant reviews - and what makes people give higher/lower ratings. 
* Compare sentiment analysis to review rating
* Categorize sentences/ideas within reviews

For the last part, I use unsupervised learning in the form of an LDA model. I use shiny to try and explain the various topics and how to represent what each topic might represent.
